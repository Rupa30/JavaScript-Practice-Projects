# Simple Weather App

This is a basic weather application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches weather data for a user-specified location and displays it on the page. The app also includes error handling to gracefully manage situations where an invalid city name is entered.

### Features

* Displays current weather information (temperature, description, icon)
* User can enter a location to get weather data
* Displays an error message if an invalid city name is entered and prevents displaying incorrect weather data

### Technologies Used

* HTML: Structure and content
* CSS: Styling and layout
* JavaScript: User interaction, fetching weather data (API required), and error handling


### Usage

1. Enter a location name in the search bar.
2. Click the "Get Weather" button.
3. The app will display the current weather for the entered location (or an error message if the city name is invalid).
