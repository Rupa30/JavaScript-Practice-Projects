# Toast Notification Project

This project provides a simple implementation of toast notifications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Toast notifications are small, unobtrusive messages that provide feedback to the user after certain actions or events, such as successful submission, errors, or invalid inputs.

## Features

- Display toast notifications for success, error, and invalid messages.
- Toast notifications appear when clicking on a particular button and will disappear after a specific time duration.

## Getting Started

To use this project, simply follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

The `index.html` file contains three buttons: Success, Error, and Invalid. Clicking on these buttons triggers the display of corresponding toast notifications, which will disappear automatically after a specific time duration.

## Customization

You can customize the toast notifications by modifying the following:

- **Message Content**: Edit the `susscessMsg`, `errorMsg`, and `invalidMsg` variables in the `script.js` file to change the message content.
- **Appearance**: Modify the CSS styles in the `style.css` file to adjust the appearance of the toast notifications, buttons, and other elements.

## Dependencies

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - Used for icons in toast notifications
